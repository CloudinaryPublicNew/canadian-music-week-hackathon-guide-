## Build an online contest using Auth0 Webtask and Cloudinary

We recently released a online [contest](https://codepen.io/cloudinary/full/LjqJEG/) to showcase our [Neural Artwork Style Transfer](/presentation-and-responsive-image-delivery/turn-photos-to-art-with-style-transfer.md) add-on feature of Cloudinary's APIs.

![](/assets/contest.png)Our goal was to show developers how to quickly build an engaging and fun online contest using _**functions as a service **or _**FAAS** and our APIs.  Check out the [contest](/h ttps://codepen.io/cloudinary/full/LjqJEG/) and [leaderboard](https://faas-cloudinary.com/wt-60a287cd40c53f6e56bd60ac8922bc3e-0/style-transfer/view/no-token),  follow the links below to review the code on our GitHub Gists.
