## Choose a Serverless Stack

Resist the urge to create an express app and deploy a server for this one! Instead, focus on using each API directly within a Single Page App \(SPA\) to take advantage of the responsive design possibilities.

Cloudinary's APIs work extremely well with Auth0 [Webtasks](https://webtask.io) and other serverless platforms. We support many languages, including JavaScript and [Node.js](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration).

## Use This Guide to Get Started

We've organized the Cloudinary resources in this guide by functionality so you can quickly add a feature to your application. Each article is a short and concise walkthrough, so you won't have to comb too deep through our extensive [documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation), unless you want to.

## Tweet/Share your Experience

We know your Hackathon experience will be fun and engaging. Don't forget to share that with your friends on social media. _**In fact, we've added links at the top of this guide to make sharing easy.**_ Learning about visualizing an audio waveform? Show the world what you are working on and let them learn about the technologies right along with you.

## Tell us About your Cool Hack
