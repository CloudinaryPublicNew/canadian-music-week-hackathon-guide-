## Build a Music Discovery Service

Create a community-based music sharing and discovery site. Make the focus on user-generated content,  let your users  [upload](/uploading/upload-videos-from-dropbox-and-other-sources.md) their music, tag and categorize their music.
  
Engage users with [beautiful visualizations](/visualization/audio-to-waveform-images.md) the music audio and video tracks.   Showcase each video using our [HTML5 Video Player](/audio-and-video/html-5-video-player.md).    Display beautiful layouts of artists,  album art and fan photos in [rich and responsive layouts](/performance/rich-image-delivery.md) and [sized perfectly ](/performance/auto-crop-responsive-images.md)for your design and each type of device.

Use our powerful APIs to search the fan photos and videos that have been[ auto-tagged and automatically identified](/auto-tagging-facial-recognition-and-ai/add-ons-and-other-features.md) upon upload. Add [content moderation](/auto-tagging-facial-recognition-and-ai/content-moderation.md) to ensure that your user uploads meets your community standards.

### Choose a Serverless Stack

Resist the urge to create an express app and deploy a server for this one!  Instead, focus on using each API directly within a Single Page App \(SPA\) to take advantage of the responsive design possibilities.

Cloudinary's APIs work elegantly with Auth0 [Webtasks](https://webtask.io) and other serverless platforms.  We support many languages, including JavaScript and [Node.js](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration).

### Use This Guide to Get Started

We've organized the Cloudinary resources in this guide by functionality so you can quickly add a feature to your application. Each article is a short and concise walkthrough, so you won't have to comb too deep through our extensive [documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation), unless you want to.

### Tweet/Share your Experience

We know your Hackathon experience will be fun and engaging.  Don't forget to share that with your friends on social media.   _**In fact, we've added links at the top of this guide to make sharing easy.**_. Learning about visualizing an audio waveform? Show the world what you are working on and let them learn about these cool technologies, right along with you.
